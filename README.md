# Construction_And_Demolition_On_Waste_Management

# Introduction
Waste management or waste disposal includes the processes and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal.[1] This includes the collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste, together with monitoring and regulation of the waste management process and waste-related laws, technologies, economic mechanisms.
   The aim of waste management is to reduce the dangerous effects of such waste on the environment and human health. A big part of waste management deals with municipal solid waste, which is created by industrial, commercial, and household activity.
   Proper management of waste is important for building sustainable and liveable cities, but it remains a challenge for many developing countries and cities. A report found that effective waste management is relatively expensive, usually comprising 20%â€“50% of municipal budgets.

# Impact
Air- Waste while disassembled generates dust and large particulates. It affects the respiratory health of waste management workers.
water- Landfills are not enough capable to hold waste and compounds leach to the ground and then groundwater gets toxified due to heavy metals.
Soil- Soil of the area is directly contaminated by the waste or during recycling or disposal. Waste consisting of lead mercury, cadmium, and arsenic has a bad impact on soil and then on the water.

# Results
1. To segregate it from municipal waste.
2. Mixing waste will reduce the recycling option.
3.The efficiency of waste processing will reduce if not properly segregated.
4. For maintaining the safety of workers and laborers.
5. To have a targeted solution to pollution generated by construction waste.

# Conclusion
Construction and demolition waste management rules are introduced to deal with construction and demolition waste. The rule specifies the responsibility of different stakeholders involved in the process from generating waste to recycling it.  The concern related to the rule needs to be addressed by taking accountability and considering anything related to the environment should be dealt with in logical, sustainable steps.
